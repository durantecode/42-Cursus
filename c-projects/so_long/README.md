# so_long - your first 2D game #

## This is my so_long project for 42-Cursus Madrid 2021 ##

The aim of this project is to introduce you in the use of the Minilibx and (finally) some graphic interface.
I strongly recommend to learn the basic functions of the mlx library first.
If you need help with this, here are some tutorials made by fellow students that will definetly help you on this task:

  [MiniLibX sample guide](https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/miniLibX_sample) \
  [madebypixel's pacman](https://github.com/madebypixel02/so_long) \
  [qst0](https://github.com/qst0/ft_libgfx#minilibx)

They both did an amazing job explaining how it works, and also in their personal so_long projects. Go check them out! ;)

In my case, I did a simple game where the player (Let's call him Pit) is really hungry for Donuts & Nutella, so he needs to collect
all the donuts on screen before he can get the Nutella jar, also there's an angry alien trying to stop him.
This is how the game looks:

It includes all the bonuses, enemy patrols, animations and movement counter displayed on screen.
Feel free to clone and execute the game:

  - Use the rule make test and then select a map number (1-6) to play. feel free to create new maps.
  - ASDW as arrow keys to control the player
  - ESC or red cross to quit clean

ENJOY!
